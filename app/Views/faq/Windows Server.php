$intro = '<p>Open-AudIT should be installed on 64bit Windows <strong>Server</strong> systems only. Windows 10 and Windows 11 are <strong>not</strong> supported.</p>';

$body = '
<p>Microsoft Windows desktop systems have network limitations that may impact the performance of Open-AudIT. The TCP/IP stack limits the number of simultaneous incomplete outbound TCP connection attempts. After the limit is reached, subsequent connection attempts are put in a queue and will be resolved at a fixed rate (10 per second). If too many enter the queue, they may be dropped. And finally, Apache will be restarted by the OS. For this reason, installing Open-AudIT on a Windows desktop operating system is not supported.<br><br>
There is nothing wrong with the Open-AudIT code, nor can we do anything to address this issue on Windows client machines.<br><br></p>

<h2>Alternatives?</h2>
<p>You can always run the Firstwave VM on your virtual infrastructure (ESX, Azure, et al). The Firstwave VM runs Debian linux and is free from OS licensing concerns and limitations. Or install on your own Linux distro of choice. We support Redhat 9, Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 and 24.04 as well as Debian 11 and 12.<br><br></p>

<h2>But I Only Have Windows Client Machines Available!</h2>
<p>Then you can use Open-AudIT (unsupported) to receive audit data directly from the clients. Discovery <strong>will fail</strong>, but if you\'re not using Discovery (the main feature Open-AudIT was designed around), you can still get device data. You would need to run the audit scripts directly on the clients using cron, or use the Windows Agent feature (Enterprise only).<br><br>

You can also <a href="' . url_to('devicesExampleForm') . '">import the example device data</a> and review what is possible.<br><br></p>
