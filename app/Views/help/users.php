    <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p>A user has a primary Org as well as a list of Orgs they can access. A user combines this with a list of assigned roles that define what actions they can take on items assigned to the Orgs they have access to. The combination of a users \'orgs\' and \'roles\' define what they can and cannot do within Open-AudIT.<br></p>
