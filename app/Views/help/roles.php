$intro = '<p>The "Roles" endpoint allows you to manage the set of permissions(Create, Read, Update, Delete) that are granted to the users and are applied to each endpoint.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p>The primary method for authorization (what a user can do) is now based on the users\' Roles. Roles are defined as admin, org_admin, reporter, and user by default. Each role has a set of permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each endpoint. Standard roles as shipped should cover 99.9% of use-cases. The ability to define additional roles and edit existing roles is enabled in Open-AudIT Enterprise.<br>
