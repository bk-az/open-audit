$intro = '<p>The Executables feature scans the disk of a device as part of the audit and checks that every executable file is known to the package manager. Because it uses the package manager, the feature applies to Linux target devices only, and further than that, only rpm or deb based distributions. Anything Redhat or Debian based should work.</p>
    <p>Any files found in this manner are stored in the \'executable\' table as per any other device component.
    <p>This feature, because it has the ability to affect target devices more than usual must be manually enabled. To enable this feature, change the configuration item feature_executables to \'yes\'.';

$body = '<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
        <p>You are able to define extra directories to be scanned as entries in the Executables collection. When defined, the directory and all sub-directories are scanned for files that are executable. You can also define directories and files to be excluded. When activated, these are injected into the linux audit script and performed whenever it is run (usually as part of a discovery). If you want these in a script you can manually copy to the target, use menu -> Discover -> Scripts -> List Scripts and download the script from there.</p>
        <p>As the audit script uses bash, you can use the wildcard of * when you\'re defining directories and exclusions.</p>';
